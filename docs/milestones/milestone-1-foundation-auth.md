# Milestone 1: Foundation & Authentication System

## Overview
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Focus**: Core infrastructure and security  
**Status**: Pending  
**Prerequisites**: None (Starting milestone)

## Objectives
Establish the foundational architecture and authentication system that will support all subsequent features. This milestone ensures proper security, role management, and basic project structure.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Role-Based Authentication System
- **Admin Role**: Full system access
- **Manager Role**: Product and order management access
- **Salesperson Role**: Order processing and customer service access
- Custom middleware for role-based route protection
- Permission-based access control for different admin sections

### 2. Database Schema Design
- User management tables with role assignments
- Base tables for future features (products, orders, categories)
- Proper indexing and relationships
- Migration files following Laravel conventions

### 3. Admin Dashboard Foundation
- Base admin panel structure
- Role-based navigation menu
- Dashboard layout with placeholder widgets
- Responsive admin interface using Tailwind CSS

### 4. User Management System
- User CRUD operations for admins
- Role assignment interface
- User profile management
- Account status management (active/inactive)

### 5. Authentication Features
- Enhanced login/logout functionality
- Password reset and update system
- Email verification system
- Session management
- Remember me functionality

### 6. Project Setup Optimization
- Laravel + Inertia.js + React configuration refinement
- TypeScript setup and configuration
- Tailwind CSS custom configuration for brand colors
- Development workflow optimization
- Code quality tools setup (Laravel Pint, Pest)

## Technical Requirements

### Database Tables
- `users` (enhanced with roles and profile fields)
- `roles` 
- `permissions`
- `role_permissions`
- `user_roles`
- `password_reset_tokens`

### Middleware
- `RoleMiddleware` for role-based access
- `PermissionMiddleware` for granular permissions
- Enhanced `HandleInertiaRequests` for shared auth data

### Components (React/TypeScript)
- `AdminLayout` component
- `RoleBasedNavigation` component
- Enhanced `AuthenticatedLayout`
- User management interface components
- Login/Register form enhancements

### Routes
- Admin panel routes with role protection
- User management routes
- Authentication routes enhancement
- API routes for user management

## Deliverables

### Backend
- [ ] Complete role-based authentication system
- [ ] Database migrations for user management
- [ ] User management controllers and models
- [ ] Role and permission middleware
- [ ] Admin panel base structure

### Frontend
- [ ] Enhanced login/register pages
- [ ] Admin dashboard layout
- [ ] User management interface
- [ ] Role-based navigation components
- [ ] Responsive design implementation

### Testing
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Role-based access tests
- [ ] User management tests
- [ ] Middleware functionality tests

### Documentation
- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Role and permission system documentation
- [ ] Authentication flow documentation
- [ ] Setup and configuration guide

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All three user roles (Admin, Manager, Salesperson) function correctly
- [ ] Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] User management system allows CRUD operations
- [ ] Password reset system works via email
- [ ] Admin dashboard provides proper foundation for future features
- [ ] All authentication tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and quality standards

## Dependencies
- Laravel 12 base installation
- Inertia.js and React setup
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Email service configuration for password resets

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with basic role system, enhance gradually
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing Breeze setup
- Test authentication flows thoroughly before proceeding
- Document any custom implementations for future reference

## Notes
- This milestone sets the foundation for all subsequent development
- Focus on security best practices from the beginning
- Ensure the authentication system is scalable for future enhancements
- Pay special attention to proper TypeScript typing for auth states
